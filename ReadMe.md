ðŸŒ±ðŸ“š The goal of this project is to understand the possible implementations of memory routines, such as `memcpy`, `memmove`, etc. Some of the impressive and low-level features may seem like *"They just work!"*, but nothing in computer science is a myth or magic.  

ðŸ”¥ This project aims to offer the algorithms that are as performant as the C standard library implementations.  

# ðŸ§° Prerequisites Components for the Build Environment.
- Linux:  
1. Ninja Build System.  
2. The latest version of LLVM/Clang.  
3. The latest version of CMake.
